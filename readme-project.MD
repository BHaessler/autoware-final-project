Project Description: Final Project for 465 (Secure Transportation Systems)

Details: We decided to slightly switch gears from our original idea (Blindness of car's systems due to loss of camera data and function) to swapping the data streams of the LiDAR detectors (front receives back stream and back receives front stream). This will have the same affect we originally proposed of blinding the car's systems just in a different way. 

### First attempt at disrupting the Lidar Sensors

  We discovered in our research that is was possible to show all of the processes running in the docker container. We then decided to look into these to see if this might be able to help us find a way to disrupt the sensors. We then went back to researching and found that we could end processes running in docker if we knew their PID, or the id of the process. 
  We then looked through our docker PIDs using the command ps -aux which shows all the running processes in Linux, and decided to try ending the ray_ground_classifier to see if we could see a difference in the Autoware visualization (results shown below). After noting the changes, we decided to try and kill the velodyne_node process (the before and after of that are also shown below) 
   
   **Before ending ray_ground_classifier node** - 
   This node helps the vehicle to distinguish the ground and non-ground points. The green lines appeared are the ground, and non-ground points are in white. Ray ground classier node is a system designed to differentiate between the ground points and non-ground points using point cloud data. This node acts as a filter to determine when there is an object detected and/or free space detected within the environment of the vehicle. Input for this node is a block point containing X, Y, Z coordinates and its ray ID. The points with the same ray ID are contiguous. Output for this are two block points, one for ground and one for non-ground. These points also contain X, Y, Z coordinates and the ray ID.

   **After ending ray_ground_classifier node** - 
   After killing this node on the terminal using command kill 1118158, the lines in green and white to differentiate between ground and non-ground points disappeared.

   **Before ending velodyne node** - 
   This node was used to perceive UDP packets that have been generated by the LiDAR sensor from the data and position points, then turn them into point clouds. These points were used to help the autonomous vehicle to create the 3D map to perceive its surroundings, shown on the Autoware visualization.

   **After ending velodyne node** - 
   The shell command that killed this process resulted in all the points on the visualization to completely disappear. This is due to the data points collected through LiDAR as UDP packets cannot be converted into point clouds, since the velodyne_node process to do this was terminated.
